# Student Information System Database
--------------

## Project Description
This project contains a series of queries in response to the specific needs of a fictional client. The client needed a relational database for managing their student's details. This project explored the basics of managing a SQL database, specifically focussing on managing users and the privileges they have to edit the database. The second part of the project explores views and procedures.

### This Project Explores
- Using Grant statements to assign privileges to users.
- Using the revoke statement to remove privileges from users.
- Creating and managing Roles and Privileges
- Creating Views to provide easy-to-understand snapshots of student data, including a calculated field for age categories.
- Implementing Stored Procedures to streamline the process of adding new students to the database, ensuring consistent data entry and returning useful information.
- Developing User-Defined Functions to support the school store's operations by creating a flexible discount calculation function.
